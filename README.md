# Human-Activity-Recognition

A Machine Leaning model for recognition of human activity was created using smartphone data. The model for human activity recognition classifies sequences of data recorded by smartphones into well-defined human activities. It involves predicting the movement of a body based on the sensor data and involves deep knowledge of the domain from signal processing to correctly measure the features from the data to fit into a machine learning model.
